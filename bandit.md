- The format in which we need to use the ssh is "user@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p port"

- After getting into the port use the command ls
- ```ls - is used to list files```
- After which i used cat command
- ```cat - is used to to display the content of a file```
- Then i received the password for the first level
