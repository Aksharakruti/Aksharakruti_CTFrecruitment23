- Firstly as soon as I opened the challenge I started to read the discription.
- After reading the discription I downloaded wireshark from google then I clicked on view attachments and downloaded the file.
- ```Packet_Sniffing.pcap```
- After downloading the file I clicked on view file and it will directly open in wireshark app
- it will lead us to a page like this

- Then you can see that the whole text on the right is being selected
- Then when i right click on the "JPEG File Interchange Format", I will find an option call export packet bytes, like this
