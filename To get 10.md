# ToGet10
```misc```
----
- Firstly as soon as I opened the challenge I started reading the description
- Then I found out that the code should be written in C language
- So I opened an online C Compiler to code for the challenge
- In the description of the challenge it is given that we have to assume that we will receive all 10's in the future assignments
- We need to find the minimun number of future assignments to recieve a final grade of 10
- So I wrote the code as follows
- ![img](https://github.com/Aksharakruti/Aksharakruti_CTFrecruitment23/blob/main/screenshots/toget10.png.jpeg)
- After running the code i entered the values
- ```Enter the number of grades: 2```
- ```Enter the grade : 8 9```
- ```Minimum number of future assignments needed is 4``` is the output
- After getting the result which i needed i copied the code into notepad and saved it in the format given in the google form
- Then i submitted the code
- Finally i got the flag
- ## FLAG- bi0s{hmm_was_it_too_easy?_93817418419effd}
