# Fruit Ninja
```crypto```
-----------------------------------
- Firstly as soon as I opened the challenge I started to read the discription.
- After reading the discription I clicked on view attachments and downloaded both the files
- ``` chall.py and ciphertext.txt```
- I opened both the files and found out that the chall.py file has a code in it and the ciphertext.txt has a cipher text which should be inserted in the code to get the flag
- So after looking into the code i noticed that the plain text is given as comment with "#" in the front.
-  '#' is given to let the computer know that the sentence which u have given is for a comment for the users understanding and the computer will ignore the sentence entered after that.
- As it was given in a comment which it should'nt have been,I removed the # in front and in the place of (flag{REDACTED}) i replaced it with the ciphertext given in the ciphertext file 
- Then I ran the code.
- Finally I got the flag.
