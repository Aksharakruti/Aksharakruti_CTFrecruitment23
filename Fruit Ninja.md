```crypto```
Firstly as soon as I opened the challenge I started to read the discription.
After reading the discription I clicked on view attachments and downloaded both the files which are named chall.py and ciphertext.txt
I opened both the files and found out that the chall.py file has a code in it and the ciphertext.txt has a cipher text which should be inserted in the code to get the flag
so after looking into the code i noticed that 
finally the flag i got is "flag{t0mat0_!s_7he_imp0st3rYh3r3}"
