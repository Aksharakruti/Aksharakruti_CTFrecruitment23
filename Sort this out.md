# Sort this out!!!
```Misc```
-
- Firstly I read the description
- Then I opened view attachments and downloaded the "data.txt" file.
- After downloading the file I right clicked on the file and copied its path and saved it on notepad
- Then I opened jupyter notebook to write the following code 
- ![img](https://github.com/Aksharakruti/Aksharakruti_CTFrecruitment23/blob/main/screenshots/sort%20this%20out.png.jpeg)
-   After which i pasted the copied path in the "with open" command
-   (with open("C:\\Users\\aksha\\Downloads\\data (3).txt","r") as file:) as such
-   After running the code I got the output in binary code "0110011001101100011000010110011101111011001100110111011000110011011100100111100101110100011010000011000101101110001110010101111100110001011100110101111100110101011011110101001001110100001100110100010001111101"
-   Then i used google to decode this binary text.
-   Which then gave me the flag required
  ## FLAG- "flag{3v3ryth1n9_1s_5oRt3D}"
